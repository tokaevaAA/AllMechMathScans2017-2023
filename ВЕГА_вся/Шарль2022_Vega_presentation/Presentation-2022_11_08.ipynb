Calibration of a simple equity/rate model: suppose we observe in the market the discount factors, the volatility of the rates (e.g. calibrated from caps/floors or swaptions) from which we have deduced an expression for the dynamic of the zero coupon bond as above, the forward of an asset, the Black implied volatility for several maturities $T_i$ (no smile), and the correlation between rates and equities (if the short rate was described by a vasicek model, and the asset by a lognormal model, how would you calibrate this correlation on historical data?).

    "The Black-Scholes framework is unrealistic but, with a proper change of measure, we have shown that we can use an almost identical formula to compute European option prices and define an implied volatility from it, which aggregates the uncertainty coming from the rates with the idiosyncratic movement of the stock price.\n",
    "\n",
    "In term of dynamic hedging, what the Black model implies is that it is possible to perfectly replicate a European option in a context where both rates and assets are stochastics (under the hypothesis of a fixed volatility for the forward) by executing the delta hedge  with the forward at the maturity of the European option, and by funding the self financing stategy with a term deposit to the settlement date. In practice, this is impossible, which means that equity traders are exposed to the fluctuation of the interest rates. That is why they must hedge their sensitivity to the interest rates ($rho$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, this perfect replication strategy can only be used for derivative claims referencing a single observation date. If multiple observation dates are required, one needs to properly specify the stock process and the rate process to account for convexity adjustments. Obviously, the simplest approach is to use deterministic rates, which makes all forward measures identical to the risk neutral measure (this is what we do when we compute local volatilities using Dupire formula for example).

    "From the formula above, we need three additional elements, apart from the option price, to solve the inverse problem:\n",
    " - the time to maturity $T-t_0$, as a year fraction, which we can compute as long as we are clear on which daycount convention to use (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention). **It is common practice to express all volatility time in act_365**, meaning to count the number of days between $t_0$ and $T$ and divide it by 365.\n",
    " - the discount factor to maturity. In the case of US stocks, the market curve for discounting options is the SOFR curve, for which there is an overnight rate published by the Federal Reserve of New York (https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/sofr), quotes available for Term instruments (https://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/cme-group-benchmark-administration/term-sofr.html), and swap quotes available through broker markets. As a general rule, never try to imply it from option quotes.\n",
    " - the forward to maturity $F(t_0, T)$. There are two possibilities here:\n",
    "    - to use the formula above if we have a view on expected repo rate and dividends (some information is available on yahoo, but be very careful: it is called \"dividendRate\" and it is in fact a cash amount, and it is not a market implied information),\n",
    "    - to use call/put parity when we have both contracts traded for the same strike (recall that $\\text{call}(K,T)-\\text{put}(K,T)=DF(t_0,T)(F(t_0,T)-K)$ is model independent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is my personnal cooking recipe for the computation of the forward:\n",
    "1. take a dividend yield hypothesis, set repo rate to 0, and use the market standard for interest rates (SOFR here) to estimate the value of the forward,\n",
    "2. look for options with strikes around that estimated forward where both calls and puts are traded for the same strike,\n",
