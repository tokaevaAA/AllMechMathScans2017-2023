 abstract = {We introduce a stochastic process that describes a finite-velocity damped motion on the real line. Differently from the telegraph process, the random times between consecutive velocity changes have exponential distribution with linearly increasing parameters. We obtain the probability law of the motion, which admits a logistic stationary limit in a special case. Various results on the distributions of the maximum of the process and of the first passage time through a constant boundary are also given.},

 abstract = {We consider a generalized telegraph process which follows an alternating renewal process and is subject to random jumps. More specifically, consider a particle at the origin of the real line at time t = 0. Then it goes along two alternating velocities with opposite directions, and performs a random jump toward the alternating direction at each velocity reversal. We develop the distribution of the location of the particle at an arbitrary fixed time t, and study this distribution under the assumption of exponentially distributed alternating random times. The cases of jumps having exponential distributions with constant rates and with linearly increasing rates are treated in detail.},

    abstract = { Mathematical models of moving particles without overtake on a circle are considered. Each particle may slow down the motion of the other. There is a leader-particle that can push other particles. The necessary and sufficient conditions are found when each separately considered particle makes a random binomial walk. The numerical results of simulation for complicated models of moving particles that allow construction of a road diagram for traffic systems and reveal such undesirable phenomena as traffic jams in these systems are presented. }

    abstract = { We present an emergent stochastic flocking dynamics of the {Cucker--Smale} (CS) ensemble under randomly switching network topologies. The evolution of the CS ensemble with randomly switching topologies involves two random components (switching times and choices of network topologies at switching instants). First, we allow switching times for the network topology to be random so that the successive increments are i.i.d. processes following the common probability distribution. Second, at each switching instant, we choose a network topology randomly from a finite set of admissible network topologies whose union contains a spanning tree. Even for the fixed deterministic network topology, the CS ensemble may not exhibit a monocluster flocking, depending on the initial data and the decay mode of the communication weight functions measuring the degree of interactions between particles. For the flocking dynamics of the CS ensemble with these two random components, we first use a priori conditions on the network topologies and the uniform boundedness of the position diameter, and derive the flocking estimates via matrix theory together with a priori conditions, and then replace the a priori condition for the position diameter by some suitable condition on system parameters and communication weight. A priori conditions on the network topology will be guaranteed by the suitable spanning tree time-blocks with probability one. }
